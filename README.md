# MultiWOZ 2.4
This is the dataset described in the paper: **MultiWOZ 2.4: A Multi-Domain Task-Oriented Dialogue Dataset with Essential Annotation Corrections to Improve State Tracking Evaluation. Fanghua Ye, Jarana Manotumruksa, Emine Yilmaz.**

MultiWOZ 2.4 is a refined version of MultiWOZ 2.1. Specifically, we carefully rectified all the annotation errors in the validation set and test set. We keep the training set intact.

MultiWOZ 2.1 shares exactly the same format as MultiWOZ 2.1., thus it is pretty easy for us to run existing models that are built upon MultiWOZ 2.1 on MultiWOZ 2.4.
